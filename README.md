# NovaAI
This multi-AI agent system has been developed to automate research and writing blogs. On the basis of the given topic as input, it researches and  fetches all the relevant content related to that particular topic and based on its 'research', it jots down a comprehensive blog or a structured document along with the bibliography of the research done by the Agent.

I am using Mixtral 8x7B LLM for this project

Working to make it more complex and multidimensional
